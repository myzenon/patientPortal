        How does it work?
      </b>
      <br />
      You fill out the questions in the Arine website, and our pharmacists will analyze both your responses and the information we receive from your health plan to see where any improvements or changes need to be made to help you achieve better health. Our pharmacists then call you to go over any issues that have been identified, and to make suggestions on how these can be improved. They then follow up with your doctor to make sure that your doctor is aware of these suggestions. Finally, our pharmacists compile several useful reports for you, including a personal medication list and a medication action plan, that you can access through the Arine website.

        What do I get out of this?
      </b>
      <br />
      Our goal is to make sure that you are on the safest, most effective medications for your condition, and that you are on the right track for your health. We also want your healthcare team to know all the medications you are on, and any changes that might be recommended because of your condition or other factors. Also, we provide you with a medication action plan, which includes recommendations from our pharmacists, and a personal medication list, which you can take with you to any doctor's appointment. It is also an opportunity for you to ask our pharmacists any other questions you have about your medications.

        What types of questions will Arine ask me?

        Why do you need to know about my medications?
      </b>
      <br />
      Your health plan is required to make sure you are receiving appropriate care if you are on multiple medications. Arine partners with your health plan to understand what medications you're on, and to see if there are any improvements that can be made in your care. This program is required by the government to make sure that your health plans are doing all they can to help you.
